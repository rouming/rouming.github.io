Welcome! My name is Roman Penyaev and here, in Why So Serious, I try
to reflect my learning path in software and hardware engineering by
collecting ideas, experiments, and research projects that I've persued
throughout my life and career. These experiences drive, motivate, and
push me to keep studying and exploring.

I've always been interested in theoretical research and practical
implementations of operating systems. For more than a decade, I've
been tinkering with the Linux kernel, developing distributed data
storage, and contributing to file systems. I've also had the
opportunity to develop a power electronics solution for charging
drones, and I must say, I have a very special warm relationship with
drones themselves. Drone autonomous landing, using technologies like
UWB and ultrasound, has been a favorite topic of mine, in which I've
achieved [some success](https://github.com/rouming/precise-landing).

And, of course, I must mention my ongoing passion for digital signal
processing, an area I've been studying for a quite some time and
trying to master in practice.

In short, while this blog might seem like just another among the many
discussing various software and hardware technologies, I'm absolutely
sure that its name certainly stands out. Why this name? Well, why are
you so serious then? Chill and have some fun.
